# Pack: measure

> Post-launch findings from real search, AI-answer and user data (06 § 7). They run only in `measure` (channel `measure`, 04 § 1.1), only read production, never run in `verify` and never change a release verdict (TR-252). Every rule is W: a finding is a signal for `iterate`, with its evidence and the significance rule that raised it (06 § 9.8). A rule whose source isn't connected is `BLOCKED(source: <capability>)` with its unblock step (TR-210).

## 1. Policy section

```jsonc
"measure": {
  "topPositions": 10,              // MSR-002: a target query outside this is reported
  "ctrFloorRatio": 0.5,            // MSR-004: CTR below this share of the expected CTR for the position
  "minImpressions": 50,            // MSR-003, MSR-004: ignore queries with fewer impressions in the window
  "conversionPages": 20            // MSR-009: how many top-traffic target pages are checked for conversions
}
```

## 2. Rules — `MSR-*`

- **MSR-001** · W · measure — Target pages are indexed: each planned page's index status (Search Console URL Inspection) is indexed. Otherwise the finding gives the coverage state the engine reports.
- **MSR-002** · W · measure — Ranking: each target query whose position worsened significantly (06 § 9.8), or which ranks outside `measure.topPositions`. The finding gives the position, the change, and the domains now above us.
- **MSR-003** · W · measure — Unplanned demand: a Search Console query with ≥ `measure.minImpressions` impressions in the window, matching no cluster's queries (whole words after NFKC and lowercasing). It is proposed for the next research run (TR-211).
- **MSR-004** · W · measure — Low click-through: a target query at position ≤ 5 whose CTR is below `measure.ctrFloorRatio` × the expected CTR for that position (ruleset `ctr-curve.json`), with ≥ `measure.minImpressions` impressions. The finding points at the page's title and description.
- **MSR-005** · W · measure — AI visibility: a cluster question whose citation rate fell significantly, or is 0 while a competitor is cited. The finding gives the provider, the cited sources and the date.
- **MSR-006** · W · measure — Field speed: a planned page or origin whose p75 LCP, INP or CLS (`crux`) is "needs improvement" or "poor", or got worse by status (06 § 9.8).
- **MSR-007** · W · measure — Authority: a significant loss of referring domains since the last run, and the link-intersect prospects of the off-site plan (TR-233) still not linking.
- **MSR-008** · W · measure — Cannibalisation in results: two or more of the site's URLs received impressions for one target query in the window, and the planned page is not the one with the most impressions.
- **MSR-009** · W · measure — Traffic without conversions: among the `measure.conversionPages` target pages with the most clicks, a page with clicks but no conversion of its cluster's goal (`analytics`) in the window.
- **MSR-010** · W · measure — Local consistency: a business directory listing (TR-218) whose name, address or phone differs from `business.json`, or a market where the business has no listing on a directory of ruleset `citation-sources.json`.
